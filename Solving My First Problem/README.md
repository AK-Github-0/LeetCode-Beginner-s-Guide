### I solved my first LeetCode problem!

# Approach
The approach to solving this problem is as simple as I wanted. Given two integers, we need to return their sum. Therefore, the function will directly return the sum of the two input integers.

# Complexity
## Time complexity: O(1)
The time complexity is constant since the addition operation takes a constant amount of time regardless of the input values.

## Space complexity: O(1)
The space complexity is also constant because no additional space is required beyond the input variables.

# Code
```python
class Solution:
    def sum(self, num1: int, num2: int) -> int:
        return(num1 + num2)
```
