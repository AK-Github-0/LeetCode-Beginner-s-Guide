### I solved my first LeetCode problem!

# Intuition
To solve this problem, my first thought was to focus on a straightforward arithmetic operation. I wanted to keep it short and simple.

# Approach
The approach to solving this problem is the most simple. Given two integers, we need to return their sum. Therefore, the function will directly return the sum of the two input integers.

# Complexity
## Time complexity: O(1)
The time complexity is constant since the addition operation takes a constant amount of time regardless of the input values.

## Space complexity: O(1)
The space complexity is also constant because no additional space is required beyond the input variables.

# Code
```python
class Solution:
    def sum(self, num1: int, num2: int) -> int:
        return num1 + num2
```
